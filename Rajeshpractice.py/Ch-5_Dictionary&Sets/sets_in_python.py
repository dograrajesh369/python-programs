 # set is a collection of non repetitive element 

'''
s= set()  ==>  no repetition allowed!!
s.add(1)
s.add(2)  ==>  or set ={1,2}

if you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical operation on sets, you can simply look 
at set in python as data type containing unique values:
properties of sets :-
1) sets are unordered = element order doesn't matter
2) sets are unindexed = cannot access elements by index
3) there is no way to change items in sets.
4) sets cannot contain duplicate values.

'''
{}--> use for dictionary,  ()--> it is use for tuple, []--> use for list 
'''
a= {1,2,3,4,5}
print(a)
print(type(a))
