sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. for instance: print 1 to 1000
loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer, which set of instructions to repeat and how!!
        types of loops in python:-
        primarily there are two types of loops in python:-
        1) While loop
        2) For loop
        we look in these one by one!!
        While loop:-
        the syntax of a while loop looks like this :
        while condition:  ===> the blocks keep executing until the condition is true.
        #body of the loop
        in while loop the condition is checked first. If it evaluate to true, the body of the loop is executed,
        otherwise not!! 
        an example:- 
        i=0
        while i<5:
                print("harry")   ===> print"harry" - 5 times!
                i=i+1
Note:- if the condition never become false, the loop keeps getting executed

for loop :-
A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list , tuple or string[lterables]
the syntax of a for loop looks like this:
L= [1,7,8]
for item in L:
        print (item)

Range function :-
the range function in python is used to genrate a sequence of numbers
we can also specify the start, stop, step-size etc as follows:
